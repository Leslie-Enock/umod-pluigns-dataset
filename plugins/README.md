# Alphabetical Plugin Categorization

In this directory, plugins are organized by the first letter of their name to facilitate navigation and solve the GitHub limitation on displaying a large number of files.

## Directory Structure

Plugins are distributed across 26 categories - one for each letter of the Latin alphabet:

| Category | Number of Plugins |
|----------|-------------------|
| A | 105 |
| B | 105 |
| C | 142 |
| D | 93 |
| E | 61 |
| F | 58 |
| G | 40 |
| H | 41 |
| I | 59 |
| J | 4 |
| K | 20 |
| L | 44 |
| M | 113 |
| N | 95 |
| O | 18 |
| P | 106 |
| Q | 18 |
| R | 99 |
| S | 140 |
| T | 87 |
| U | 27 |
| V | 27 |
| W | 45 |
| X | 3 |
| Y | 1 |
| Z | 10 |

## How It Works

Each plugin is placed in a directory corresponding to the first letter of its name, for example:
- `A/AdminPanel/` - the AdminPanel plugin is located in category A
- `Z/ZoneManager/` - the ZoneManager plugin is located in category Z

## Usage

To find a specific plugin:
1. Determine the first letter of its name
2. Go to the corresponding letter directory
3. Find the desired plugin within the directory

## Creating the Categorization

This structure was created using the `alphabetical_categorizer.py` script, which copies the original plugins into a new organized structure.
